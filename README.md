TensorFlow Neural Network Playground

Overview

In this project, I explored the TensorFlow Neural Network Playground, an interactive tool for visualizing and experimenting with neural networks. This playground allows users to understand the mechanics of neural networks by manipulating various parameters and observing the results in real-time.

 My Exploration

During my exploration, I tested different configurations of neural networks, including:

- Changing the Number of Layers: I experimented with adding and removing layers to see how model complexity affects performance.
- Adjusting Activation Functions: I tested various activation functions (e.g., ReLU) to understand their impact on learning.
- Modifying Learning Rates: I set the learning rate to 1 to observe its influence on model convergence.
- Applying Regularization: I used L1 regularization with a regularization rate of 0.1 to help manage overfitting.
- Using Different Datasets: I experimented with various built-in datasets to see how the model performs under different conditions.
- Configuring the Problem Type: I focused on a classification problem, with a training-test data ratio of 70%.
- Setting Noise: I set the noise level to 10 to evaluate the model's robustness.
- Batch Size: I used a batch size of 5 and included 2 hidden layers in the architecture.

Results

After training the model, I observed the following losses:

- Training Loss: 0.529
- Test Loss: 0.540

This hands-on experience helped deepen my understanding of key concepts in neural networks, such as overfitting, underfitting, and the importance of hyperparameter tuning.

Getting Started

To replicate my experiments or further explore the TensorFlow Neural Network Playground, you can access it at [TensorFlow Playground]. Here are some steps to help you get started:

1. Choose a Dataset: Select from various datasets available in the playground.
2. Configure Your Network: Adjust the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and other parameters.
3. Train the Model: Click on the "Run" button to start training and observe the results in real-time.
4. Analyze Performance: Watch for signs of overfitting or underfitting as you adjust the settings.

Feel free to experiment and discover how different configurations impact the model's performance!
